	I was part of major refactoring project, as we were needed to re-implement all existing legacy features using latest architecture, design patterns, improved test cases, performance enhancements, CI/CD support etc. With my work and guidance to reporting devs, the app performance increased to 20%, decreased the overall bug count and helped in faster deliveries of features in on-going sprints.
